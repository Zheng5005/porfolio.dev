      My name is Fernando Gómez. <strong>I'm a software developer</strong> who likes to create apps that make a difference, from small but powerful apps to Enterprise level apps, I'm all in.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among my success stories I want to mention the time I was in College, me and my friends <strong> made a mini-startup called SmartEnterprise</strong>, where we worked with a lot of local stores to improved their user experience and their sales.
    </p>

    <p>
      With SmartEnterprise and other projects <strong>I have a ton of experience working with a team in a variety of apps</strong> to deliver the best quality and being the fit for the team.
