      My name is Fernando Gómez. <strong>I'm a software developer</strong> who enjoys creating apps that make a difference, from small but powerful apps to Enterprise level apps, I'm all in.
    </p>

    <p>One of my success stories dates back to my time in college, when my friends and I <strong>created a mini-startup called SmartEnterprise.</strong> We collaborated with several local stores to improve their user experience and boost their sales.</p>

    <p>Through SmartEnterprise and other projects, I've gained <strong>extensive experience working in teams across a variety of applications</strong>, always striving to deliver top-quality results and be a strong team player.</p>
